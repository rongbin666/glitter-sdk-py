## Requirements

Terra SDK requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python v3.8+</a>.

## Installation

<sub>**NOTE:** _All code starting with a `$` is meant to run on your terminal (a bash prompt). All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>._</sub>

Terra SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:

```
$ pip install -U glitter_sdk
```

<sub>_You might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup._<sub>


## Dependencies

Terra SDK uses <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to manage dependencies. To get set up with all the required dependencies, run:

```
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```
